# 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops
## Learning Objectives
- What are nested loops and how to use them
- What is a function and how do you use functions
- What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
- What is a prototype
- Scope of variables
- What are the `gcc` flags `-Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89`
- What are header files and how to to use them with `#include`

## Tasks
[0. isupper](0-isupper.c) - A function that checks for uppercase character.  
[1. isdigit](1-isdigit.c) - A function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).  
[2. Collaboration is multiplication](2-mul.c) - A function that multiplies two integers returning the answer.  
[3. The numbers speak for themselves](3-print_numbers.c) - A function that prints numbers from 0 to 9.  
[4. I believe in numbers and signs](4-print_most_numbers.c) - A function that prints the numbers, 0 to 9 without 2 and 4.  
[5. Numbers constitute the only universal language](5-more_numbers.c) - A function that prints out 0 to 14 ten times.  
[6. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line](6-print_line.c) - A function that draws a straight line.  
[7. I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe](7-print_diagonal.c) - A function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.  
[8. You are so much sunshine in every square inch](8-print_square.c) - A function that prints a square using the # sign.  
[9. Fizz-Buzz](9-fizz_buzz.c) - A function that does the Fuzz_Buzz sequence.  
[10. Triangles](10-print_triangle.c) - A function that prints a triangle.  

## Requirements
- All the files are compiled on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS` using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- The code uses the `Betty` style. Checked using `betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl`.
- [_putchar.c]( _putchar.c) is used to write the output.
- In the examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test the functions.
- [main.h](main.h) - The custom header file.
