![love dogs](image.jpg)
## Learning Objectives
- What are structures, when, why and how to use them.
- How to use `typedef`.
## Tasks
[1. A dog is the only thing on earth that loves you more than you love yourself](1-init_dog.c) - This function initializes a variable of type struct dog. When run, we generate the file b.  
[2. A dog will teach you unconditional love. If you can have that in your life, things won't be too bad](2-print_dog.c) - Prints out the struct dog. We generate the file c.  
[4. A door is what a dog is perpetually on the wrong side of](4-new_dog.c) - A function that creates a new dog function. We run it to generate the file e.  
[5. How many legs does a dog have if you call his tail a leg? Four. Saying that a tail is a leg doesn't make it a leg](5-free_dog.c) - A function that frees the used space on the memory off structs.  

> The dog.h is the header file in use in this directory. Files 0-main.c to 5-main.c are used to test the code and the files a to f are as a result of compilation.
