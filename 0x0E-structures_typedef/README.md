# 0x0E. C - Structures,typedef

This directory contains code to solve a series of project problems.
1. [1-init_dog.c](1-init_dog.c) - This function initializes a variable of type struct dog. When run, we generate the file b.
2. [2-print_dog.c](2-print_dog.c) - Prints out the struct dog. we generate the file c.
3. [4-new_dog.c](4-new_dog.c) - creates a new dog function. we fun it to generate the file e.
4. [5-free_dog.c](5-free_dog.c) - A function that frees the used space on the memory off structs.

> The dog.h is the header file in use in this directory. Files 0-main.c to 5-main.c are used to test the code and the files a to f are as a result of compiation.
