For a start, let's learn the commands used in execution of C files and a few C programms.
1. [0-preprocessor](0-preprocessor) - runs a C file through a preprocessor and saves the results into another file.
2. [1-compiler](1-compiler) - compiles a C code without linking.
3. [2-assembler](2-assembler) - generates a C code assembly code saving it in an output file.
4. [3-name](3-name) - a script that compiles and creates an executable.
5. [4-puts.c](4-puts.c) - uses the puts function to print out a string.
6. [5-printf.c](5-printf.c) - prints out a specific string.
7. [6-size.c](6-size.c) - prints out the sizes of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
8. [100-intel](100-intel) - generates the assembly code to a C code saving it in an output file.
9. [101-quote.c](101-quote.c) - prints out a specific string.
