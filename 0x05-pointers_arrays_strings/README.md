# 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings
## Learning Objectives
- What are pointers and how to use them
- What are arrays and how to use them
- What are the differences between pointers and arrays
- How to use strings and how to manipulate them
- Scope of variables

## Tasks
[0. 98 Battery st.](0-reset_to_98.c) - A function that takes a pointer to an int as paremeter and updates the value to 98.  
[1. Don't swap horses in crossing a stream](1-swap.c) - A function that swaps the values of two integers.  
[2. This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read](2-strlen.c) - A function that returns the length of a string.  
[3. I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them](3-puts.c) - A function that prints a string.  
[4. I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear](4-print_rev.c) - A function that pronts a string in reverse.  
[5. A good engineer thinks in reverse and asks himself about the stylistic consequences of the components and systems he proposes](5-rev_string.c) - A function that reverses a string.  
[6. Half the lies they tell about me aren't true](6-puts2.c) - A function that prints evey other character of a string, starting with the first character.  
[7. Winning is only half of it. Having fun is the other half](7-puts_half.c) - A function that prints half of a string.  
[8. Arrays are not pointers](8-print_array.c) - A function that prints n elements of an array of integers.  
[9. strcpy](9-strcpy.c) - A function that copies a string and ncludes the terminated null byte to the buffer pointed to by `dest`.  
[10. Great leaders are willing to sacrifice the numbers to save the people. Poor leaders sacrifice the people to save the numbers](100-atoi.c) - A function that converts a string into an integer.  

## Requirements
- All the files are compiled on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS` using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- The code uses the `Betty` style. Checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- [_putchar.c](_putchar) is used to write the output.
- In the examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test the functions.
- [main.h](main.h) - The custom header file.
