# 0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings
## Learning Objectives
- What are pointers and how to use them
- What are arrays and how to use them
- What are the differences between pointers and arrays
- How to use strings and how to manipulate them
- Scope of variables
## Tasks
[0. strcat](0-strcat.c) - A function that concatenates two strings.  
[1. strncat](1-strncat.c) - A function that concatenates two strings using at most n bytes from the second bit.  
[2. strncpy](2-strncpy.c) - A function that copies a string.  
[3. strcmp](3-strcmp.c) - A function that compares two strings.  
[4. I am a kind of paranoid in reverse. I suspect people of plotting to make me happy](4-rev_array.c) - A function that reverses the content of an array of integers.  
[5. Always look up](5-string_toupper.c) - A function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.  
[6. Expect the best. Prepare for the worst. Capitalize on what comes](6-cap_string.c) - A function that capitalizes all words of a string.  
[7. Mozart composed his music not for the elite, but for everybody](7-leet.c) - A function that encodes a string in the 1337 leet way.  
[8. rot13](100-rot13.c) - A function that performs rot13 encoding in the simplest form.
## Requirements
- All the files are compiled on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS` using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- The code uses the `Betty` style. Checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- [_putchar.c](_putchar.c) is used to write the output.
- In the examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test the functions.
- [main.h](main.h) - The custom header file.
