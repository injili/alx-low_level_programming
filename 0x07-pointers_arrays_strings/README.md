# 0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings

## Learning Objectives
- What are pointers to pointers and how to use them.
- What are multidimensional arrays and how to use them.
- What are the most common C standard library functions to manipulate strings.

## Tasks
[0. memset](0-memset.c) - A function that fills the memory with a constant byte.  
[1. memcpy](1-memcpy.c) - A function that copies memory area.  
[2. strchr](2-strchr.c) - A function that locates a character in a string.  
[3. strspn](3-strspn.c) - A function that gets the length of a prefix substring.  
[4. strpbrk](4-strpbrk.c) - A function that searches for any set of bytes.  
[5. strstr](5-strstr.c) - A function that locates a substring.  
[6. Chess is mental torture](7-print_chessboard.c) - A function that prints the chessboard.  
[7. The line of life is a ragged diagonal between duty and desire](8-print_diagsums.c) - A function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.  
## Requirements
- All the files are compiled on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS` using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- The code uses the `Betty` style. Checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- [_putchar](_putchar.)c is used to write the output.
- In the examples, the `-main.c` files are shown as examples. You can use them to test the functions.
- [main.h](main.h) - The custom header file.
