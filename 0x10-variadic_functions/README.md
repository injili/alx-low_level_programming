# 0x10. C - Variadic functions
## Learning Objectives
- What are variadic functions
- How to use `va_start`, `va_arg` and `va_end` macros
- Why and how to use the `const` type qualifier
## Tasks
[0. Beauty is variable, ugliness is constant](0-sum_them_all.c) - A function that returns the sum of all its parameters.  
[1. To be is to be the value of a variable](1-print_numbers.c) - A function that prints numbers.  
[2. One woman's constant is another woman's variable](2-print_strings.c) - A function that prints strings.  
[3. To be is a to be the value of a variable](3-print_all.c) - A function that prints out anything.  
## Requirements
- All the files are compiled on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS` using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- The code uses the `Betty` style. Checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- [_putchar](_putchar.)c is used to write the output.
- In the examples, the `-main.c` files are shown as examples. You can use them to test the functions.
- [main.h](main.h) - The custom header file.
